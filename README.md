## Results
- VPN often reduces speed due to encryption and rerouting.
- IP changes to the VPN-hosted region.

## VPN encryption and privacy features

| **Feature**                 | **Explanation**                                                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AES-256 Encryption**      | Industry standard used for military-grade data encryption.                  |
| **Perfect Forward Secrecy** | Ensures session keys change frequently, even if one is compromised.         |
| **No-Log Policy**           | The VPN provider claims not to store user activity data.                    |
| **Kill Switch**             | Disconnects the internet if VPN connection drops, preventing IP leaks.      |
| **Split Tunneling**         | Lets users route some apps through VPN and others through regular internet. |
| **DNS Leak Protection**     | Ensures DNS queries are encrypted and don't expose your browsing habits.    |
| **Multihop/Double VPN**     | Routes traffic through two VPN servers for extra privacy.                   |

## Summary

### ✅ Benefits:

- Anonymity & IP Masking: Hides your real IP to protect identity.
- Data Encryption: Secures sensitive data on public or unsafe networks.
- Bypass Geo-blocks: Access restricted content like Netflix US, BBC iPlayer, etc.
- Avoid Censorship: Useful in countries with strict internet restrictions (e.g., China, Iran).
- Safer Public Wi-Fi: Protects your data in airports, cafes, etc.

### ⚠️ Limitations:

- Reduced Speed: Encryption and server routing can slow connections.
- Trust in Provider: If provider keeps logs, your data may still be exposed.
- Not Fully Anonymous: Browser fingerprinting and cookies can still track users.
- Illegal in Some Regions: VPN use is banned or restricted in countries like Russia, China, UAE.
- May Not Work With All Sites: Some services block VPN IPs (e.g., banking sites, streaming platforms).
